# Battleship
Simple battleship game completed in CptS 121 (Program Design and Development). Written in Spring of 2015 as a new programmer. At any given time the player sees either their board (with revealed ship locations) or the computer's board (without revealed ship locations). The player gets the chance to hit the computer's board, and the board will change throughout the game to show where the player has tried to hit. The computer will also hit the player's board, and the player can see where the computer tried to hit.
